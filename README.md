### Exercise 1: Course Class
**Description:** Create a `Course` class where each course has a name, a description, and a list of enrolled students.

**Methods:**
- `add_student(student)`: Adds a student to the course.
- `remove_student(student)`: Removes a student from the course.
- `show_all()`: Displays all students in the course.

### Exercise 2: Student Class
**Description:** Create a `Student` class where each student has a name, ID number, address, and a list of enrolled courses.

**Methods:**
- `enroll(course)`: Enrolls the student in a course.
- `drop(course)`: Drops the student from a course.
- `show_courses()`: Shows all registered courses.

### Exercise 3: Registration Class
**Description:** Create a `Registration` class that manages courses and students. 

**Methods:**
- `add_student(student)`: Adds a student to the registration system.
- `add_course(course)`: Adds a course to the registration system.
- `enroll_student_in_course(student, course)`: Enrolls a student in a course.
- `drop_course(student, course)`: Drops a student from a course.
- `show_enrolled_courses()`: Shows all courses in the registration system.
- `show_students()`: Shows all students in the registration system.

### Exercise 4: Adding Grades and GPA Calculation
**Description:** Extend the `Student` class to manage grades for each course and calculate the GPA.

**Methods:**
- `add_grade(course, grade)`: Adds a grade for a student in a specific course.
- `GPA()`: Calculates the student's GPA based on enrolled courses and grades.
